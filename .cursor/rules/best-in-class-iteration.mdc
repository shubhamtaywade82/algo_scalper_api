# Best-in-Class Iteration

When the user asks to make the system **best-in-class**, to **iterate until done**, or to **keep testing and improving until the system is best-in-class**:

1. **Read and follow** `docs/BEST_IN_CLASS_ITERATION.md` as the single source of truth.
2. **Each round:** Run the full verification suite (RuboCop, Brakeman, test suite). Fix any failure. Repeat.
3. **Do not stop** after one successful run. Only stop after **two consecutive full passes** of the verification suite.
4. **Exit** by reporting: "Best-in-class iteration complete." when the exit criteria in that doc are met.

If the user says "continue" or "keep going" after you report completion, run the verification suite again and fix any new failures, then repeat the two-pass rule.
