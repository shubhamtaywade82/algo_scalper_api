# Documentation Guidelines

- Use ATX headings with Title Case for all level-one and level-two headings.
- Number sequential procedures to emphasize order of operations.
- Include at least one table when documenting environment variables or configuration matrices.
- Highlight critical cautions using blockquotes that start with `> **Warning:**`.
- Prefer concise paragraphs under 90 characters per line to keep diffs readable.
